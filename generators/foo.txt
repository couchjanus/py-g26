WHO USES foo?
Foobar is not equivalent to the WWII military term FUBAR, 
an acronym for “Fucked Up Beyond All Recognition.” 
Though it’s possible that the linking of foo and bar might 
have grown out of familiarity with and playful allusion to FUBAR,
 programmers using foobar do not use it in this sense.

“Foo was here” was a popular piece of graffiti drawn 
by Australian soldiers in WWII, and possibly even WWI,
 that depicts a little man poking his head and large nose over the wall à la Kilroy. 
 While the origins of this foo are unclear, it appears to be unrelated to Holman’s foo.

Foo’ is sometimes also used as a shortening of fool in English dialects,
 often a reference to the way the word was said by Mr. T in The A-Team. 
 This has no connection to the programming term.

JUST ADDED
Sweetest Day, Hallmark holiday, stealthing, shadow docket, National Coming Out Day
